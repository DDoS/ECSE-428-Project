	Given I am an anonymous user or registered user
	And I want to find a particular argument or an argument that contains specific keywords
	I should be able to search for that argument by viewing a list of arguments matching particular keywords

Scenario: Obtain agrument search results using one keyword
	Given I open the url "http://mayhem-ecse428.rhcloud.com/arguments/search"
	And the title is "Search Arguments - Mayhem"
	When I set "keyword" to the input field "#search"
	And I click on the button ".btn.btn-search"
	Then I expect that the title is "Argument Search Result - Mayhem"
	And I expect that element "#view_arguments_date_asc" becomes visible

Scenario: Obtain argument search results using multiple keyword
	Given I open the url "http://mayhem-ecse428.rhcloud.com/arguments/search"
	And the title is "Search Arguments - Mayhem"

	And I click on the button ".btn.btn-search"
