# Gherkin Acceptance Test for Sorting Argument Search Result

Feature: Sorting Argument Search Results
    Given I am an anonymous user or a registered user
    And I want to view the arguments listed for each question in some order
    I should be able to sort the arguments by date and by votes

Scenario: Obtain argument search results in ascending order by date
	Given I open the url "http://mayhem-ecse428.rhcloud.com/arguments/search"
	And the title is "Search Arguments - Mayhem"
	When I set "keyword" to the input field "#search"
	And I select the option with the name "date_asc" for element "sort"
	And I click on the button ".btn.btn-search"
	Then I expect that the title is "Argument Search Result - Mayhem"
	And I expect that element "#view_arguments_date_asc" becomes visible

Scenario: Obtain argument search results in descending order by date
	Given I open the url "http://mayhem-ecse428.rhcloud.com/arguments/search"
	And the title is "Search Arguments - Mayhem"
	When I set "keyword" to the input field "#search"
	And I select the option with the name "date_des" for element "sort"
	And I click on the button ".btn.btn-search"
	Then I expect that the title is "Argument Search Result - Mayhem"
	And I expect that element "#view_arguments_date_des" becomes visible

Scenario: Obtain argument search results in ascending order by vote score
	Given I open the url "http://mayhem-ecse428.rhcloud.com/arguments/search"
	And the title is "Search Arguments - Mayhem"
	When I set "keyword" to the input field "#search"
	And I select the option with the name "vote_asc" for element "sort"
	And I click on the button ".btn.btn-search"
	Then I expect that the title is "Argument Search Result - Mayhem"
	And I expect that element "#view_arguments_vote_asc" becomes visible

Scenario: Obtain argument search results in descending order by vote score

	When I set "keyword" to the input field "#search"
	And I select the option with the name "vote_des" for element "sort"
	And I click on the button ".btn.btn-search"
	Then I expect that the title is "Argument Search Result - Mayhem"
	And I expect that element "#view_arguments_vote_des" becomes visible

Scenario: Obtain Argument Search Results failed due to empty keywords
	Given I open the url "http://mayhem-ecse428.rhcloud.com/arguments/search"
	And the title is "Search Arguments - Mayhem"
